***** CONFIG FILE FOR DEVICE (aka SENSORTHING) demo_D00 *****

***** it contains data such as this SensorThing name, model, unique identifier, status, sensors. *****
***** parameters follow the patterns [paramID] "value" *****
***** for each supported sensor (e.g. temperature), this file contains data about said sensors, like their id, names, etc, and their measurements, such as measuredData (e.g. 20 Â°C), time of the last measurement, etc ***** 
***** measured data are currently unused / ignored, but inserted for future work purposes where the data could be made permanent *****
***** parameters for each supported sensor follow this pattern:  {paramID} "value" *****
